    "Linear Regression: This model imposes a linear relationship between predictors and our outcome of interest and estimates these relationships by minimizing the sum of squared residuals (loss function). Linear regression assumes this linear relationship as well as normality of errors, homoskedasticity and no multicollinearity. Benefits of linear regression include easier interpretability and computational efficiency. Drawbacks of linear regression include high bias when the relationship is not in fact linear and sensitivity to outliers. It is a plausible choice for this problem because of the potential policy application, which makes interpretability a high priority. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LASSO: LASSO is a regularized version of linear regression that imposes a penalty to the loss function that drives coefficients to zero, allowing for feature selection. It is helpful when there are many covariates in the model but likely that some are irrelevant. It does run the risk of shrinking a coefficient to zero that is in fact relevant, depending on the tuning of the model. It is a plausible choice for this problem because it retains the basic idea of linear regression and interpretability, and may be preferred to linear regression because there are many potential covariates and the LASSO model will be helpful to achieve a more parsimonious model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge: Ridge is similar to LASSO in that it imposes a penalty on the linear regression loss function, but it does not tend to fully shrink coefficients to zero. It assumes that all features contribute in some way. Ridge tends to reduce overfitting when there are many covariates in the model, but it does not perform feature selection like LASSO and can be less interpretable. It is a plausible choice here as it is possible that all of the covariates available are in fact relevant but some much more than others. Feature selection may not be the best approach but some regularization helps to address some of the drawbacks of a standard linear regression. "

    "In machine learning problems like this one, we are interested in creating models that minimizes total error such that it can be applied to new data and still predict outcomes well. Total error includes both bias and variance. A model that has high bias is underfitting the data and will have a hard time accurately predicting our target variable with given data. This can happen for example when we fit a linear regression model to data that is highly non-linear and therefore the model does not capture important patterns in the data and will not predict well out of sample. A model that has high variance is likely overfitting the model, with the most extreme case being that the model responds to every fluctuation in the training data, so performs well in this context, but then performs poorly when applied out of the training context. While these are both problems we would like to avoid in machine learning applications, they are fundamentally related to each other such that our attempts to decrease one likely increases the other, i.e. improving an underfit model by adding complexity will reduce bias but increase variance. We therefore must balance these two considerations and seek to minimize error with both of these factors in mind. "

    "The LASSO model which I found to be the best model in this analysis selects the above shown features as important predictors of diabetes rates at the county level. This model says that counties with the highest rates of obesity and physical inactivity rates are those that have the highest diabetes rate and could potentially benefit more from the program. These features have the strongest relationship to diabetes rates. Other important features are the population that is aged 65-74, indicating that this population may benefit particularly from a program focused on diabetes. The model finds similar magnitude but a negative relationship to the percentage of the population that is white, indicating that counties with a high percentage of white residents should receive less priority than other counties. The model also indicates that counties with a larger percentage of the population that is non-Hispanic Black are more likely to have higher rates of diabetes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dropping considerations of race, gender, or age composition would affect the counties chosen, as those with similar rates of obesity and physical inactivity but with different race and age compositions would still have different predicted rates of diabetes. Still, the most important features are obesity and physical inactivity rates, and it is possible that a model just including these variables could have ok performance, but it would have higher error than the current model. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am not very confident in deploying this model in this setting. First, while this model may indicate certain counties that have higher rates of diabetes, it says nothing of the effectiveness of the prevention program across different populations. For example, this model would suggest that the program should be targeted at counties with higher Black populations, but it is possible that the intervention itself was not designed well for Black people, and so would be less effective in this environment even if there is higher need and potential for impact here. In addition, the model does not explain very much of the variation in the data and I am therefore concerned that we are missing critical pieces of information that could inform better targeting of the intervention than this model would currently create. \n",
